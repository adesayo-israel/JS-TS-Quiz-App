## 📘 1. Introduction

This tutorial walks you through building a **timed, multi-page quiz app** using JavaScript or TypeScript. It’s tailored for:

## 🧱 2. Project Structure
📁 quiz-app/
├── index.html # Main quiz interface
├── guidelines.html # Start page with test instructions
├── results.html # Final result & review
├── questions.js # JavaScript question bank
├── script.js # Quiz logic (rendering, scoring, timer)
└── style.css # Custom styles

📌 *Tip: Use modular files to separate logic, UI, and data.*

## 📜 4. Question Bank Format

```js
const questionBank = [
  {
    question: "What is closure in JavaScript?",
    options: [
      "Inner function",
      "Prototype",
      "Event loop",
      "Variable scope"
    ],
    answer: 0
  }
];
✔️ Simple JSON format with one correct answer index.

🧠 5. Core JavaScript Functions
Key Methods Used
Array.sort() – Shuffle questions

Array.fill() – Initialize user answer state

setInterval() – Timer countdown

querySelectorAll() – Select buttons

addEventListener() – Event handling

Logic Functions
renderQuiz();   // Renders each question to DOM
submitQuiz();   // Calculates and shows score
startTimer();   // Begins 2-minute countdown

🧪 6. UX Optimizations
✅ Sticky timer bar for test pressure

✅ Bold styling on selected options

✅ Disabled buttons after selection

✅ Clear visual feedback with colors

✅ Mobile responsiveness

💡 Good UX improves user engagement and fairness in tests.

🔄 7. Multi-Page Flow
guidelines.html ➡ index.html ➡ results.html

🧭 Step-by-Step Flow:

Guidelines Page – Shows quiz instructions

Quiz Interface – Timer-based multiple choice quiz

Result Page – Shows score and incorrect answers

🧱 8. Optional Improvements
Here are ways to make the app production-grade:

🧾 Export scores as downloadable PDF

📁 Load questions via API for scalability

💾 Save quiz progress using localStorage

📊 Add analytics dashboard

🔐 Add login/auth for personalized sessions

🚀 9. Deployment Tips
📦 Recommended Platforms:

GitHub Pages

Netlify

Vercel

💡 Use environment variables or secure APIs for backend integration if needed.

### ✅ Next Steps

- I can help you **add badges**, **optimize this for GitHub**, or **embed screenshots/demo GIFs**.
- Want a **Figma-style layout** for this as well? Let me know!

Would you like me to create this as a `README.md` file and export it for you now?
