## 📘 1. Introduction

This tutorial walks you through building a **timed, multi-page quiz app** using JavaScript or TypeScript. It’s tailored for:

- 👩‍💻 Tech interviews
- 🏫 Coding bootcamps
- 🧠 Self-assessments or student testing

It includes dynamic logic, modern design, and scalable code structure.

## 🧱 2. Project Structure
📁 quiz-app/
├── index.html # Main quiz interface
├── guidelines.html # Start page with test instructions
├── results.html # Final result & review
├── questions.js # JavaScript question bank
├── script.js # Quiz logic (rendering, scoring, timer)
└── style.css # Custom styles

📌 *Tip: Use modular files to separate logic, UI, and data.*

## ⚙️ 3. Features Implemented

| Feature                 | Description                         |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| ⏱️ Timer Countdown      | Auto-submit after 2 minutes         |
| 🎯 Random Question Set  | Selects 30 random questions         |
| 🧠 Locked-in Answers    | Prevents changing answers post-click|
| 📊 Score Evaluation     | Highlights correct and wrong answers|
| 🌐 Responsive Design     | Mobile and desktop friendly         |
| 📉 Result Display       | Final score and review section      |

---

## 📜 4. Question Bank Format
```js
    const questionBank = [
    {
        question: "What is closure in JavaScript?",
        options: [
        "Inner function",
        "Prototype",
        "Event loop",
        "Variable scope"
        ],
        answer: 0
    }
    ]
```
    ✔️ Simple JSON format with one correct answer index.

---

## 🧠 5. Core JavaScript Functions
We used fundamental and advanced JavaScript methods to make the quiz dynamic and interactive.

### 🔧 Core Methods:

- **`Array.sort()`** – Used to shuffle the question bank randomly.
- **`Array.fill()`** – Initialized the user answer array.
- **`setInterval()`** – Managed countdown timer execution.
- **`querySelectorAll()`** – Selected buttons for disabling or styling.
- **`addEventListener()`** – Captured quiz submissions and button clicks.

### 🧠 Code Logic Breakdown:
```js
function renderQuiz() {
  // Displays all 30 random questions
}

function submitQuiz() {
  // Scores and displays answers visually
}

function startTimer() {
  // Countdown timer that auto-submits at zero
}
```

## 🧪 6. UX Optimizations
✅ Sticky timer bar for test pressure

✅ Bold styling on selected options

✅ Disabled buttons after selection

✅ Clear visual feedback with colors

✅ Mobile responsiveness

💡 Good UX improves user engagement and fairness in tests.

## 🔄 7. Multi-Page Flow
This quiz was split into three functional pages to simulate a real-world exam experience:

| Page              | Purpose                                          |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `guidelines.html` | 📋 Shows instructions and quiz policy            |
| `index.html`      | 🎯 Main quiz interface with timer                |
| `results.html`    | 🧾 Score display and review of incorrect answers |

📍 Flow Diagram:
Start → Guidelines → Quiz → Results → [Review Wrong Answers]

## 🧱 8. Optional Improvements
Here are ways to make the app production-grade:

🧾 Export scores as downloadable PDF

📁 Load questions via API for scalability

💾 Save quiz progress using localStorage

📊 Add analytics dashboard

🔐 Add login/auth for personalized sessions

---

## 🚀 9. Deployment Tips
You can host this app easily using modern frontend platforms:

🌍 GitHub Pages – Quick and free

⚡ Netlify – CI/CD with custom domains

📦 Vercel – Perfect for frontend-focused apps

💡 Pro Tip: If using a backend, hide credentials with .env and a secrets manager.

💡 Use environment variables or secure APIs for backend integration if needed.
